<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
There are many great codes available on GitHub and Stackoverflow, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to store coding template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. Collections of snippets that solves a problem and helps others
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

I'll be adding more snippets in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed.
